# Multiple CTRL + H

## What's my purpose ?

This is a fairly simple project that does... well, multiple CTRL + H at once (because I didn't wan't to do the manipulation 20 times)


## How do I configure it ?

The project works with little configuration :

```
Everything happens in the 'config' folder !

First, drop your input file in the folder :
config

Second, give your indication in the config/config.json file :
- 'fileFullName' enter the name of the file to modify, with it's format (ex: data.sql). Please don't do anything stupid with the path here :3
- 'changes' Each change represents a CTRL + H you want to do :
  - 'from' : the text to modify;
  - 'to' : the text to change into;

The output file is the file you gave as an input, plus the modifications
```
